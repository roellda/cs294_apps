The app is functional. I didn’t have issues when navigating through the app. It was self-explanatory. I did note that when opening the app, you need to wait a second or two for the app to start running. Also, the two material components buttons need to be clicked in the center. Clicking on the corners won’t work. The UI could be improved, but it’s doing its job as is. My only feedback is maybe improve the UI using material components tabs to click on the different divs. Also, the pie chart looks a bit weird. Maybe that could be fixed too.
